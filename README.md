## Requirements

Before you start, make sure the following are in place. If you already run OpenCode with oh-my-openagent, you only need to check **Python** and **pip**.

| Requirement | Minimum | How to check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | 3.9+ (3.10 / 3.11 recommended) | `python --version` |
| pip | any recent version | `pip --version` |
| OpenCode CLI + oh-my-openagent | installed globally | `opencode --help` |
| Disk space | ~3–5 GB free (for the models) | — |

> [!TIP]
> On Windows, `pip` may need to be invoked through the same Python interpreter you used for installation. On macOS/Linux it may be `pip3`. Use whichever resolves on your machine.

### Install Python

If `python --version` fails, install Python first:

- **Windows / macOS:** download from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (on Windows, tick *“Add python.exe to PATH”* during setup).
- **macOS (Homebrew):** `brew install python`
- **Debian / Ubuntu:** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3`

### Install pip (one-liner)

`pip` ships with modern Python. If `pip --version` fails, bootstrap it with the bundled module:

```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade && python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

If `ensurepip` is unavailable, use the official bootstrap script instead:

```bash
curl -sS https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
```

On Debian/Ubuntu you can also install it from the system package manager: `sudo apt install -y python3-pip`.

**Verify:** `pip --version` should now print a version and a path.

### Don't have OpenCode + oh-my-openagent yet?

This plugin plugs into the oh-my-openagent pipeline. If you haven't set those up, follow the baseline setup first: [Part 2: A default setup](./part-2-default-setup.md) (see *Install OpenCode* and *Install and Configure Oh-My-OpenAgent*). Come back here once `opencode --help` works.

---

## Installation (CLI executable)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Current compatibility status (OpenCode JSON/JSONC configuration):**
>
> The supported activation path for current OpenCode is a **JavaScript OpenCode local plugin** that wraps the existing Python optimizer.
>
> In practice this means:
>
> - ✅ Install the Python packages.
> - ✅ Keep the plugin as one self-contained folder.
> - ✅ Keep the JS wrapper implementation in `context-optimizer/plugin/context-optimizer.js`.
> - ✅ Install that folder into your global OpenCode plugin directory.
> - ✅ Let that JS plugin call the Python bridge from the sibling `support-files/` directory.

### 1. Install dependencies

Install the two Python packages (PyTorch is pulled in automatically):

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers llmlingua
```

If you're on **Windows CPU-only** (or any machine without CUDA), install the CPU wheel for PyTorch first so the optimizer doesn't try to load a CUDA build:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch torchvision torchaudio
python -m pip install sentence-transformers llmlingua
```

If you do have an NVIDIA GPU, use the official PyTorch installer selector to pick the matching CUDA wheel for your machine instead.

> [!NOTE]
> On CPU-only installs, the optimizer automatically selects a smaller, CPU-friendly LLMLingua-2 model (`microsoft/llmlingua-2-bert-base-multilingual-cased-meetingbank`) instead of the larger CUDA-oriented `xlm-roberta-large` model. It keeps the LLMLingua-2 compression algorithm either way.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a sizeable download (PyTorch alone is several hundred MB). On a slow connection this step can take a few minutes.

**Verify the install:**

```bash
python -c "import sentence_transformers, llmlingua; print('ok')"
```

If this prints `ok`, the dependencies are ready. If you see `ModuleNotFoundError`, the packages were installed into a different Python than the one on your PATH — re-run the install with `python -m pip install sentence-transformers llmlingua` so the package and interpreter match.

---

### 2. Add the plugin files

#### Tiny install checklist

**All platforms:** do **not** copy `tests/` or any `__pycache__/` folder into the OpenCode plugins directory.

Copy the JS plugin file into your OpenCode global plugins folder:

- `context-optimizer/plugin/context-optimizer.js`

Copy the Python support files into a sibling support directory under the OpenCode config root:

- `context-optimizer/support-files/context_optimizer.py`
- `context-optimizer/support-files/context_optimizer_cli.py`
- `context-optimizer/support-files/context_optimizer_hook.py`

The JS wrapper calls the Python bridge over stdin/stdout JSON and fails open if Python or its dependencies are unavailable.

The plugin writes to `context-optimizer/context-optimizer.log` under the OpenCode config root (for example `~/.config/opencode/context-optimizer/context-optimizer.log` on macOS/Linux or `%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\context-optimizer\context-optimizer.log` on Windows).
It also persists cumulative slash-command and compaction stats to `context-optimizer/stats.json` in the same folder.

**Where is the global plugins folder?**

| OS | Path |
| --- | --- |
| macOS / Linux | `~/.config/opencode/plugins/` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\plugins\` |

Create the folders if they do not exist, then copy the files:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/plugins
cp context-optimizer/plugin/context-optimizer.js ~/.config/opencode/plugins/context-optimizer.js
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/context-optimizer
cp context-optimizer/support-files/context_optimizer.py ~/.config/opencode/context-optimizer/context_optimizer.py
cp context-optimizer/support-files/context_optimizer_cli.py ~/.config/opencode/context-optimizer/context_optimizer_cli.py
cp context-optimizer/support-files/context_optimizer_hook.py ~/.config/opencode/context-optimizer/context_optimizer_hook.py
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\opencode\plugins" | Out-Null
Copy-Item context-optimizer\plugin\context-optimizer.js "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\opencode\plugins\context-optimizer.js"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\opencode\context-optimizer" | Out-Null
Copy-Item context-optimizer\support-files\context_optimizer.py "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\opencode\context-optimizer\context_optimizer.py"
Copy-Item context-optimizer\support-files\context_optimizer_cli.py "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\opencode\context-optimizer\context_optimizer_cli.py"
Copy-Item context-optimizer\support-files\context_optimizer_hook.py "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\opencode\context-optimizer\context_optimizer_hook.py"
```

### 2a. JSON / JSONC-based configuration notes

If your OpenCode setup is configured through JSON or JSONC files, the files you will typically inspect are:

- `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` — main OpenCode config (plugin list, MCP servers, providers, agents, etc.)
- `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-openagent.jsonc` or `~/.config/opencode/oh-my-openagent.json` — oh-my-openagent user config
- legacy compatibility files may still exist as `oh-my-opencode.jsonc` / `oh-my-opencode.json`

For the current JSON/JSONC-based setup, you do **not** need a custom JSON config key to activate the wrapper once the files are copied into the global OpenCode plugin directory. OpenCode automatically loads JS/TS files from `~/.config/opencode/plugins/`.

Use the JSON/JSONC files to:

- confirm that OpenCode and oh-my-openagent are installed,
- confirm your provider/plugin environment is healthy, and
- optionally register a global npm plugin later if you decide to publish the wrapper as a package.

---

### 3. Supported activation path

For the current setup, activation is handled by the global OpenCode plugin loader after you copy the source files out of this repository.

1. Ensure these files exist in your install location:

```text
%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\plugins\context-optimizer.js
%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\context-optimizer\context_optimizer.py
%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\context-optimizer\context_optimizer_cli.py
%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\context-optimizer\context_optimizer_hook.py
```

2. Start OpenCode normally.

3. OpenCode will automatically load `~/.config/opencode/plugins/context-optimizer.js`.

4. During `experimental.session.compacting`, the wrapper will:

- collect compaction context,
- call the Python bridge,
- append an `## Optimized Context` block when optimization succeeds,
- and fall back to a no-op when Python or Python dependencies are missing.

5. Verify behavior by triggering a compaction flow and watching for the optimized context block or for a single warning message if the wrapper falls back.

**Verify the plugin loads:** confirm that `~/.config/opencode/plugins/context-optimizer.js` is present and that the compaction hook can call the Python bridge successfully.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not copy `tests/` or any `__pycache__/` folder into `~/.config/opencode/plugins/`. Keep the JS plugin separate from the Python support directory.

---

## Usage

In the supported wrapper path, the optimizer automatically:

1. Collects the compaction context documents
2. Keeps only relevant chunks
3. Removes duplicates
4. Compresses context
5. Appends the optimized result back into the compaction context from the JS wrapper

The Python core returns:

```python
context["optimized_context"]
```

The JS wrapper also adds a size summary line with the initial size, final size, and percentage saved.

The JS wrapper then replaces that result into the OpenCode compaction context as:

```markdown
## Optimized Context

...
```

### Slash commands

The plugin exposes these slash commands:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/context-optimizer` | Show help and the available command surface |
| `/context-optimizer context` | Show the current session context breakdown |
| `/context-optimizer stats` | Show cumulative pruning and compaction stats from `stats.json` |
| `/context-optimizer compress` | Run one compression pass immediately |
| `/context-optimizer config` | Show the current effective settings |
| `/context-optimizer config get <key>` | Show one safe setting |
| `/context-optimizer config set <key> <value>` | Update one safe setting |
| `/context-optimizer config reset` | Clear saved settings |

---

## Configuration

The plugin has two layers of configuration:

1. **Wrapper settings** in `context-optimizer/plugin/context-optimizer.js` control when compaction runs.
2. **Optimizer settings** in `context-optimizer/support-files/context_optimizer.py` control how text is filtered, ranked, and compressed.

### Wrapper settings

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CONTEXT_OPTIMIZER_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` | How long the JS wrapper waits for the Python bridge before failing open. |
| `CONTEXT_OPTIMIZER_MIN_CHARS` | `2000` | Minimum context size before compaction starts. |

If compaction is skipped, the wrapper still logs the skipped context size so you can see why it did not run.

### Safe config commands

Only these keys are writable:

- `timeout_ms`
- `min_chars`
- `model_limits`

Env vars still win at startup, so they act as overrides over any saved config file.
The plugin stores saved values in `context-optimizer/config.json` under the OpenCode config root.
Anything outside that whitelist stays read-only.

### Optimizer settings

These defaults live in `ContextOptimizer.__init__`:

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `compression_rate` | `0.5` | Fraction of tokens to keep during compression. Raise it to preserve more context. |
| `max_chunks` | `6` | Maximum number of top-ranked chunks kept after reranking. |
| `dedupe_threshold` | `0.9` | Cosine similarity above which two chunks count as duplicates. |
| `reranker_model` | `BAAI/bge-reranker-large` | Model used for reranking chunks. |
| `embed_model` | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Model used for deduplication embeddings. |
| `graph_budget_chars` | `1200` | Pre-prune budget for graph context. |
| `memory_budget_chars` | `1200` | Pre-prune budget for memory context. |
| `docs_budget_chars` | `1600` | Pre-prune budget for document context. |
| `total_prune_budget_chars` | `4000` | Total character budget shared across buckets before compression. |
| `error_prefixes` | `"[error]", "[context-optimizer] error"` | Documents with these prefixes are purged before pruning. |
| `protected_prefixes` | `"protected:"` | Documents with these prefixes are kept out of the error purge path. |

### Model-specific limits

You can override the optimizer per model with `model_limits`. The core checks the explicit `model` argument first, then falls back to `options["model"]`, then `default`.

```python
model_limits = {
    "default": {"compression_rate": 0.5, "max_chunks": 6},
    "gpt-4.1": {"compression_rate": 0.65, "max_chunks": 8},
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Start with the defaults. If responses lose important detail, raise `compression_rate` or `max_chunks`. If prompts are still too large, lower them.

### Process timeout and first-run warm-up

The first run downloads several GB of models and will almost certainly exceed any practical timeout. Warm the cache **once** before relying on the plugin so the first real compaction loads from disk. Override the wrapper timeout with `CONTEXT_OPTIMIZER_TIMEOUT_MS`, e.g.:

```bash
# longer timeout for slow machines (milliseconds)
export CONTEXT_OPTIMIZER_TIMEOUT_MS=300000
```

The very first run downloads several GB of models (see [What gets downloaded on first run](#what-gets-downloaded-on-first-run)) and will almost certainly exceed any practical timeout. Warm the cache **once** before relying on the plugin so the first real compaction loads from disk:

```bash
python -c "from context_optimizer import ContextOptimizer; ContextOptimizer()"
```

Run that from the directory containing `context_optimizer.py` (your installed `~/.config/opencode/context-optimizer/`). If the wrapper times out, it fails open and leaves the original context untouched.

---

## What gets downloaded on first run

The first time the plugin runs, the underlying libraries download three models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and cache them locally (under `~/.cache/huggingface/` on macOS/Linux, `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\huggingface\` on Windows):

| Model | Purpose | Configured via |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BAAI/bge-reranker-large` | Reranks chunks by relevance | `reranker_model` |
| `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Embeddings used for deduplication | `embed_model` |
| `microsoft/llmlingua-2-xlm-roberta-large-meetingbank` (CUDA) or `microsoft/llmlingua-2-bert-base-multilingual-cased-meetingbank` (CPU) | Prompt compression | LLMLingua (auto-selected by device) |

This download happens **once** and only needs network access the first time. Expect the first session to be slower while the models are fetched. Subsequent sessions load from cache.

---

## Expected Results

- 30–40% token reduction
- Faster responses
- Cleaner prompts

---

## Memory Compression

Compress before storing memory:

```python
compressed = optimizer.compress([text])
mempalace.store(compressed)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: sentence_transformers` or `llmlingua` | Packages installed into a different Python than OpenCode uses | Re-install with `python -m pip install sentence-transformers llmlingua`, or activate the same virtual environment before launching OpenCode |
| `ImportError: cannot import name 'ContextOptimizer'` | The Python bridge cannot import the core optimizer | Make sure `context-optimizer/support-files/context_optimizer.py` and `context-optimizer/support-files/context_optimizer_cli.py` stay together in the repo, and that the installed copies stay together inside `~/.config/opencode/context-optimizer/` |
| `pip: command not found` | pip not installed / not on PATH | See [Install pip (one-liner)](#install-pip-one-liner) |
| First message hangs for a long time | Models are downloading from Hugging Face | Wait for the one-time download to finish; see [What gets downloaded on first run](#what-gets-downloaded-on-first-run). Warm the cache once (see [Process timeout and first-run warm-up](#process-timeout-and-first-run-warm-up)) and/or raise `CONTEXT_OPTIMIZER_TIMEOUT_MS` |
| Hook never runs / context unchanged | The JS wrapper was not loaded or compaction did not fire | Confirm `~/.config/opencode/plugins/context-optimizer.js` exists and trigger a session compaction |
| You expect console output but see none | Logging was moved to `context-optimizer/context-optimizer.log` under the OpenCode config root | Check the `.log` file instead of the terminal |
| `/context-optimizer stats` shows zeros | Stats are read from `context-optimizer/stats.json` under the OpenCode config root | Make sure the plugin has run at least one successful optimization and that the stats file is writable |
| Compaction was skipped | The wrapper still logs skipped compactions with the context size and document count | Check `context-optimizer/context-optimizer.log` for the skip reason and size details |
| You see a warning and no optimized context block | The wrapper fell back to no-op mode because Python, dependencies, or the bridge failed | Read the warning text, fix the Python issue, and retry |
| Out-of-memory or very slow CPU | Reranker model is large | Switch `reranker_model` to `BAAI/bge-reranker-base` in `context_optimizer.py` |

---

## Done ✅

Your agent now uses efficient token-aware context.
